Movie Ticket System

This is a simple Java program that shows how movie tickets can be created and displayed using classes. It calculates the total price for all tickets and prints a clean receipt.

The project has three files:

MovieTicket.java – holds details about each movie ticket like title, seat, and price

TicketOperations.java – handles calculations and printing the receipt

Main.java – runs the program and shows the final result

Example Output
===== MOVIE TICKET RECEIPT =====
Movie: Avengers: Endgame
Seat: A1
Price: $10.50
---------------------------
Movie: Inception
Seat: B3
Price: $9.00
---------------------------
Total: $19.50

How to Run

Put all three .java files in the same folder

Open a terminal and type:

javac *.java
java Main


That’s it. The program will print the receipt with movie details and total cost.
